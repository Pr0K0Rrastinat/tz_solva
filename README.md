# tz_solva
This project is the tz for Laboratory 3.0 company Solva. The main idea for the project is create a simple game "Guess the Number". In project I use Flutter BLoC (Business Logic Component) for control the state. For me it's my first time I used those packet for control state. In past I just use simple State. So this is my project for interview.
